# Groupie Tracker

Welcome to **Groupie Tracker**! üöÄ

This project revolves around the fun task of receiving an API and manipulating the data contained in it to create a user-friendly website. Think of it as a backstage pass to all things about your favorite bands and artists! üé∏üé§

## Objective

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to:
- **Fetch and process data** from the provided API.
- **Build a website** that displays the information in creative, visual ways (cards, tables, lists, or even cool graphics)!
- **Integrate client-server communication** to handle event actions (requests & responses).
- **Display artist info** like their name(s), image, concert dates, locations, and more!

## API Structure

You will be provided with an API that contains 4 essential parts:
- **Artists**: Information about bands/artists, such as name, image, start year, first album date, and members.
- **Locations**: Data about the locations of the artist‚Äôs past and upcoming concerts.
- **Dates**: Concert dates of the artists.
- **Relation**: Links the data between artists, locations, and dates.

## Features to Implement

- **Data Manipulation & Visualization**: Choose the best way to display artist information through data visualizations such as:
  - Blocks
  - Cards
  - Tables
  - Lists
  - Pages
  - Graphics
  - And anything else you find cool!
  
- **Event/Action**: Implement an event system that responds to actions triggered by the user, such as clicking or navigating. This requires client-server communication to fetch new data dynamically.

## Project Guidelines

- **Backend**: Written in **Go**.
- **No Crashing**: Your website and server must be stable at all times.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure proper error handling so that no page breaks!
- **Good Practices**: Follow best practices for coding (clean, organized, and readable code).
- **Unit Testing**: It‚Äôs recommended to create test files for unit testing.
- **Allowed Packages**: Only use **standard Go packages**. No external libraries for now.

## Example API

Here‚Äôs an example of how the API works:
- **Artists**: `/artists`
- **Locations**: `/locations`
- **Dates**: `/dates`
- **Relation**: `/relation`

This project will teach you:
- Data manipulation and storage techniques.
- Understanding and working with **JSON**.
- Creating a frontend with **HTML**.
- Designing interactive **events and actions**.
- Client-server communication (request-response).

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Go


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Setup Go on your local machine.
3. Ensure you can run the Go backend and access the API endpoints.
4. Build your frontend to fetch data from the backend and display it.
5. Implement events to make the app interactive.

## Contribution

If something is wrong or if you want to improve the project, feel free to **submit an issue** or even better, **propose a change**! üõ†Ô∏è

## Happy Coding! üéâ
